model for predicting stock price spikes

We test for price discontinuities, or jumps, in a panel of high-frequency intraday stock returns and an equiweighted
index constructed from the same stocks. Using a new test for common jumps that explicitly utilizes the cross-covariance
structure in the returns to identify non-diversifiable jumps, we find strong evidence for many modest-sized, yet highly
significant, cojumps that simply pass through standard jump detection statistics when applied on a stock-by-stock basis.
Our results are further corroborated by a striking within-day pattern in the significant cojumps, with a sharp peak at the
time of regularly scheduled macroeconomic news announcements.
